4 Main chunks:

1. Initial setup:
Should prompt for user input and create every folder, excel entry, etc, for the given Session.

2. Initial calibration:
First, it should calibrate the ROI for the given Session, based on x number of initial layers.
Then, the exposure time (and possibly gain) should be calibratied for every dataset, based on the first x layers.

3. Data collection:
Frames for a dataset are collected, timestamped and sorted on a layer-layer basis.

4. Computation while the recoater is moving:
Reduce data by a 2nd ROI on every frame.
Print a short process summary for the user. Also note this summary in a file.
